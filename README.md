# Moonshot
This is a basic learning project to explore NASA's Apollo space program. The app allows users to learn about the missions and astronauts involved in the Apollo program. Users can view a list of missions, switch between a grid or column view, and dive deeper into details about each mission and its crew.

The source learning is from 8th project of course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
